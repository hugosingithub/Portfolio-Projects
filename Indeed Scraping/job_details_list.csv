The Role
It's Wednesday morning and the entire internet is glued to their screens. What's the occasion? The largest smartphone manufacturer in the world is livestreaming the announcement of their latest devices. You've known about them for months now, but that hasn't stopped you from tuning in - where else are you going to see a Senior VP of Software Engineering travel at warp speed around a CGI campus? With each passing announcement, the forecasts you've helped to sketch out are filled in with color. A staggered release schedule for the smartphones, re-engineered wireless earbuds... everything's going according to plan.
At the eleventh hour, a wrench in the system: a new smartwatch. Will we make accessories for it? Should we develop them? What's the addressable market? Is there any room in the production schedule? Can we get inbound freight in time? The answers to these questions hinge upon your work. Without missing a beat, you've buried your nose in years worth of data and market insights, with occasional breaks to see what the internet's peanut gallery is saying about the surprise announcement.
By the end of the day, a new forecast has been drawn up: backed by data and immune to any last-minute curveballs. Now that all of the cards are on the table, you're no longer relying on hardware keynotes to fill in any missing details. Not only are we proceeding with development, our first shipment is going to be in the right place at the right time... with the right quantity to boot. None of this would have been possible without the keen insights provided by our Supply Chain Analyst.
Does this sound like your Wednesday? Of course not. You don't work here... yet. Want to change that? Keep reading.
The Environment
Still here? Excellent. At dbrand, expect a clean, modern, well-lit warehouse with desks, chairs, and rows of inventory bins. The warehouse floor? You could eat off it. Should you? Who can say? We're not scientists. Instead, we're a team who works hard and plays hard. There's nothing we're more committed to than ongoing growth... other than unparalleled product quality and customer experience.
What's in it for you? Well, unlike most companies, we actually care about the work we're doing. Our customers deserve no less than the absolute best. At dbrand, you have the opportunity to create once-in-a-lifetime purchase experiences for them. If you're someone who's detail-oriented, committed, and excited about our mission, you'll do more than thrive here.
